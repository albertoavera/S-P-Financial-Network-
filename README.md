# S&P Financial-Network
A project I spent a bit of time working on during my graduate study.  Here is a great example of live data extraction by simply using API's. Here in this example, I used yahoo finance's API in my notebook to extract information from last quarter end.  I made a very comprehensive video presentation showing my network graph that I later imported into Gephi in order to make a a final interactive display!
